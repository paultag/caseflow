        %p Sorry! The document dates do not match between VACOLS and VBMS. Please do the following to fix:
        %ol
          %li Login to VBMS.
          %li
            Do an eFolder search for
            %span(ng-bind="certifications.data.info.efolder_id")
            \.
          %li For documents that have "Not Found" listed above, but do actually exist in the eFolder, make sure that the receipt date field is set in VBMS.
          %li For documents that have an incorrect date in VBMS, fix the receipt date in VBMS.
          %li For documents that have "Not Found" listed above and are not actually in VBMS, please fill out the paperwork, getting information from the appellant as needed.
          %li After complete, refresh this page to continue certifying.
        %p You may want to bookmark this page so that you can return here later.
